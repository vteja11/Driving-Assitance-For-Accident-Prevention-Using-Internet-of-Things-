# Driving-Assitance-For-Accident-Prevention-Using-Internet-of-Vehicles-

According to a  recent survey by Indian Institute of Technology Bombay 27% of crashes on Indian highways happen due to reasons beyond the control of motorists. I took up this problem as a project titled ‘Driving Assistance for Accident Prevention using internet of vehicles’ and provided a solution by the concept of connected vehicles. Our objective was to reduce the number of road mishaps and provide the information of blind spots to autonomous vehicles by sharing information between vehicles as to predict the probability of an accident and warn the driver using vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET); we could thus assist the driver . We used OMNET, SUMO for simulation computer vision and deep learning algorithms for accurate assistance. The prototype of the project will be completed by April 2019 and presented in 7th “International Conference on Innovation in Computer science and Engineering”
